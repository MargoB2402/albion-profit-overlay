# Release notes

## 1.10.0 — 2026-10-24

- Free Gathering tab with local recording sessions, grouped resource/fish stacks and expandable observation history.
- Seven-city valuation for instant sale or sell orders, best cities per item and whole harvest, configurable fees and quote freshness.
- Unknown/stale prices remain unknown; estimates do not guarantee order depth or completion. Transport costs are excluded.
- Hardened application journal and renderer. Existing Loot Tracker subscription rules are unchanged.

City valuation requires the updated `/api/overlay/harvest-prices` website endpoint. The new gameplay capture still needs live verification. Sessions are local; cloud sync, trade/awakened history and combat charts are not introduced by this release.

The installer contains protected application code. Private application sources and obfuscation mappings are not uploaded. The modified open-source agent, build instructions and third-party notices are attached separately. Npcap remains required; WinDivert is not enabled.
